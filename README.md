# Robotic-arm-mounted-on-a-movable-cart
# Overview: 
We had build a robotic arm with simple structure, light weight, capable of manipulating objects with a mass of up to 0.2 Kg attached to a Bluetooth connected movable cart.\
We have utilized **SolidWorks** and **Ansys Mechanical** for comprehensive product design and functionality of the robotic arm under real-world conditions.
We also utilized **Arduino codes** to program the functionality, incorporating commands for servo integration and motor control and used **Blynk IOT cloud** for building app interface to run robotic arm along with Arduino codes.\
We have integrated ESP 8266 and Bluetooth module HC05, demonstrating proficiency in **wireless connectivity**. We have used mecanum wheels for providing omnidirectional movement to the cart.
