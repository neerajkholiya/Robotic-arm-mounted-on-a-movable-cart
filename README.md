# Robotic-arm-mounted-on-a-movable-cart
# Overview: 
We had build a robotic arm with simple structure, light weight, capable of manipulating objects with a mass of up to 0.2 Kg attached to a Bluetooth connected movable cart.\
We have utilized **SolidWorks** and **Ansys Mechanical** for comprehensive product design and functionality of the robotic arm under real-world conditions.
We also utilized **Arduino codes** to program the functionality, incorporating commands for servo integration and motor control and used **Blynk IOT cloud** for building app interface to run robotic arm along with Arduino codes.\
We have integrated ESP 8266 and Bluetooth module HC05, demonstrating proficiency in **wireless connectivity**. We have used mecanum wheels for providing omnidirectional movement to the cart.

# Equipments Used:
 * Arduino UNO R3
 * Motor Shield L293D
 * Bluetooth Module HC05
 * ESP 8266 module
 * Mecanum Wheels

 # Files Included:
 The repository icludes the following files:
 * SolidWorks Part files
 * SolidWorks Assembly file
 * Arduino code
 * Ansys file

 # Technologies:
 * SolidWorks
 * Ansys Mechanical
 * Arduino
 * Blynk cloud

 # Future work:
 * In future we can enhance operational flexibility for better movement of the cart.
 * We can add translation motion at the end effector to increase its vertical reach which will result in increasing its overall work envelope. 
 * In future we can provide 360 degree rotational movement to the wrist by adding an additional servo motor at its wrist.
