# Robotic-arm-mounted-on-a-movable-cart
We build a robotic arm with simple structure, light weight, capable of manipulating objects with a mass of up to 
0.2 Kg attached to a Bluetooth connected movable cart. 
We have utilized SolidWorks and Ansys Mechanical for comprehensive product design and functionality of the robotic 
arm under real-world conditions.  
We have integrated ESP 8266 and Bluetooth module HC05, demonstrating proficiency in wireless connectivity. 
We also utilized Arduino codes to program the functionality, incorporating commands for servo integration and motor 
control and used Blynk IOT cloud for building app interface to run robotic arm along with Arduino codes.
